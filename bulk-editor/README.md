# Bulk Editor DatoCMS plugin

This plugin can be added to any kind of fields that
belongs to a non-singleton model.
It allows you to apply a value to all records belonging to the same model.
Something like an "it's never too late" default value.

## Configuration

You will need to specify a full-access DatoCMS API key
on the plugin global settings so the plugin can edit content.
